=================
This is a project for my compilers class.  The main goal is to be able to compile a rather simplistic language into 6502 hex op-codes.  The main parts of the project are a Lexer, a Parser and a Code Generator.

Submodules
----------
This project uses Impress.js for its interface.  I have linked my fork of Impress.js as a submodule.  You need to run `submodule init` and `submodule update` to get this dependency installed.

For more information on Git submodules check out [this article](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Submodules).  This is my first use of submodules and found that article very helpful to get started.
